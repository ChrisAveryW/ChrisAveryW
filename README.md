- 👋 Hi, I’m Christian
- 👀 I’m interested in new algorithems combined with data analysis or machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different programming languages.
     I wouldn't say I've masterd Python or Java completely because there can allways be new depth to small areas ... but do feel comfortable in these languages. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects.
